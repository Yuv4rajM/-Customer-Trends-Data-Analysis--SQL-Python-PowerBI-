#  Customer Trends Data Analysis (Python | SQL | Power BI)

##  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a **comprehensive customer behavior analysis** system that enables data-driven decision-making through the following stages:

 **Data Preparation, Modeling & EDA (Python):**  
Clean, transform, and explore raw data to uncover early trends and ensure data quality.

 **Data Analysis (SQL):**  
Simulate business transactions and extract insights about **customer segments, loyalty, and purchasing patterns** using analytical SQL queries.

 **Visualization & Insights (Power BI):**  
Design an interactive **Power BI dashboard** highlighting key trends, KPIs, and business insights.

 **Report & Presentation:**

##  Project Workflow

The entire workflow follows a structured, real-world data analytics pipeline:

1. **Data Preparation (Python)**
   - Import and clean raw customer shopping behavior dataset.  
   - Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize column names.  
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key data patterns.

2. **Database Integration (SQL)**
   - Create a new SQL database (MySQL / PostgreSQL / MS SQL).  
   - Load cleaned data from Python notebook into the SQL database.  
   - Perform **SQL-based analysis** using joins, aggregations, and window functions.

3. **Business Analysis (SQL)**
   - Identify **top-performing customer segments**.  
   - Analyze **purchase frequency, retention rate**, and **average order value (AOV)**.  
   - Explore **loyalty patterns** and key **sales drivers**.

4. **Visualization (Power BI)**
   - Connect Power BI directly to the SQL database.  
   - Design an **interactive dashboard** featuring:
     - Customer segmentation overview  
     - Revenue and order trends  
     - Product category performance  
     - Demographic insights
